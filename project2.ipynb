There are 6 missing observations for combined loan-to-value, and 2 of these are the missing values for loan-to-value, which occurs when the loanee has no other loans. None of these loans were defaults, so they have been excluded.\n",

When debt-to-income ratio is greater than 65%, it is classified as a missing value. These are loans where the monthly debt payments are greater than 65% of monthly income of the loanee suggesting that they are higher-risk loans. **How do we deal with this?**\n",
